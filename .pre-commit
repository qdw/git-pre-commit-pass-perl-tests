## Custom hook:  make sure that there are Perl tests, and that they pass.
##
## How to use:  Place this in your project's .git directory, overwriting
## the sample pre-commit (you may want to back it up first).
##
## Dependencies:  bash.  This code uses two improvements bash makes over sh:
## [[ ]] conditionals and $( ) interpolation.
